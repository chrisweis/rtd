# Vision

1. In my mind these demos are a powerful mechanism to educate the broader organization on the benefits of Agile.  Let's not lose any opportunities to advance the state of Agile / DevOps / Continuous Improvement at Columbia 

2. I'd like to weave a connected story through our various activities, using the product API service that provides a coherent theme.  

3. Over the next several demos we should be able to show a similar storyline that either introduces new components or goes deeper into a given area. 

4. Optimally, I'd like to have each of you demonstrate something so that you will get your chance to shine but I'd also like for us to gain experience running a well-orchestrated demo that has nearly seamless handoffs.  We shouldn't necessarily feel like everyone has to demo a component each sprint if it doesn't make sense 
We should record our demo on WebEx so that folks that missed the demo can take a look and we can go back and measure our progress as a sprint team  

5. Minimum Viable Process (Demo) 

6. Live demos > Cooking Show demos > PowerPoint demos 

7. Demo scripts will consistently be available prior to the sprint planning and will guide stories & backlog items.   
Every day we could run a "build" to gauge progress against the demo
