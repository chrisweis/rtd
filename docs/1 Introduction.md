# Columbia Global Retail Consumer Experience
# Architecture Roadmap
The consumer journey for Retail is ever changing and requires constant adjustments and innovation. This roadmap discusses the architecture around the core components of the Global Retail Platform and the retail experience.

## Introduction
The Global Retail Platform is a new solution designed to make Columbia Sportswear more agile and adaptive to changing consumer trends. This journey transforms Columbia into a digital data service provider.   Throughout this journey, various architectures, frameworks and standards are presented and detail the impact to the current and future state environment.  To that end Enterprise Architecture presents you with the vision, strategy and roadmap for the Global Retail Platform.

After the introduction, we detail how the Columbia or Integration teams can interact with the Global Retail Platform. After the architecture breakdown, you will find in each section the following structure that is centered around interacting with the consumers.

* Journey Scenario
* Themes 
* Case Study in Retail including Use Cases
* Reference Architecture and Data
* Frameworks and Patterns
* Guidelines
* Analytics
* Monitoring and Operations

## Journey Scenarios
The steps come from a common digital Omni-commerce retail process. The GRP follows common retail frameworks and is designed to use a common process framework. Where possible, this framework uses the BPM notation for simplicity and commonality. While GIS is not necessarily interested in the Level 1 and 2 processes, it is greatly interested in the Level 3 and 4 processes. This is because as the retail leaders draft their proposals and initiatives, GIS uses the Level 3 and 4 models to understand the integration points between the business and services, solutions or infrastructure.

## Themes
Themes are high level concepts that are being implemented and have direct impact of users. Of key note is the ability to use technology and architecture to implement the processes. The reference architecture is built based on the themes and encompasses the use cases and technology.

## Case Study in Retail
The case studies provide various use cases related to that particular step in the journey. These use cases center on the needs of the consumer, data and integrations needed to support that particular step in the journey. These use cases have clear deliverables and can be expanded upon.

## Reference Architecture and Data
The Reference Architecture presents several views of the GRP architecture and how it relates to data and API strategy. This strategy implements new technology and eliminates technical debt.

As you study the reference architecture, it becomes apparent that the key concern of this architecture is abstraction. Abstraction allows the systems being implemented to remain the owners of their own domain and enables the business to swap solutions or implement new solutions when the need arises. 

You will also note the combination of batch and real-time processing into a new paradigm called “as-data-happens”. This paradigm accommodates legacy batch and delayed data processing while implementing newer technologies and architecture patterns to bring real time insights and predictive analytics to help in the “human” decision making process.  Coupled with the “as-data-happens” paradigm are new integration architectures that save resources and provide greater insight to the data.
